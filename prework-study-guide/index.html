        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>There are three types of CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and the most common and External CSS Style Sheet</li>
          <li>When using external CSS, you link the file using the 'link' element in the HTML's 'head'</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use.  A key design principle!</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the decalarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property i.e. {declaration: value}</li>
          <li>'Text-align' will center a title or heading to a webpage</li>
          <li>'img' assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <li>The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>The 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>The 'href' given in the prework is using a relative path.  This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case the index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we need to look in the assets folder, thus the 'assets/style.css'</li>
