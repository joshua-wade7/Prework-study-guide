        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>There are three types of CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and the most common and External CSS Style Sheet</li>
          <li>When using external CSS, you link the file using the 'link' element in the HTML's 'head'</li>
          <li>Separation of Concerns refers to separating code into different files based on use.  A key design principle!</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the decalarations will apply</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property i.e. {declaration: value}</li>
          <li>'Text-align' will center a title or heading to a webpage</li>
          <li>'img' assigns property values to any image element in the markup</li>
          <li>The 'rel' attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>The 'href' attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>The 'href' given in the prework is using a relative path.  This means the location is derived from the current location (in this case the index.html). To locate the style sheet from the current location, we need to look in the assets folder, thus the 'assets/style.css'</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Control flow can be interrupted by using Conditional Statements and Loops.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive, be sure to double check work if you are receiving an error code.</li>
          <li>Use the 'var' keyword to declare a variable - after the keyword give the variable a unique name that will help us rememeber the reference later on.</li>
          <li>Use '=' to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>'Strings' are contained within quotation marks.  All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Each line of a JavaScript code ends with a semicolon ';'.</li>
          <li>'console.log' will output whatever we add inside the parenthesis to the console 'Chrome.dev.tools'</li>
          <li>The 'if' statement is a way of introducing decision making into our code within JavaScript.</li>
          <li>When 'if' is used, the code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition or is truthy.</li>
          <li>The '===' is a equality operator that checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result 'true' if the values are equal and 'false' if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An 'array' is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.  Typically, ther are used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>Arrays are paricularly useful whenwe want to perform a tast on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>An 'index' is added when we want to work with individual items within an 'array'.</li>
          <li>Indices are always in a predictable pattern starting with [0].</li>
          <li>The 'for' loop is used when we have numerous items within an array.</li>
          <li>Three important steps for 'for' loops.</li>
          <li>1. Starting at the beginning of an array we declare a varibale 'x' and give it a value of '0'.</li>
          <li>2. The second statement if the condition.  As long as the number in the variable 'x' is less than the length (the number of items in the array) of the array, the loop will keep running i.e. 'x < shapes.length';.</li>
          <li>3. The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item.  Since the indices follow a predictable pattern, the number will increase by '1' each time.  The code 'x++' is a shortcut of writing 'x+1'.</li>
          <li>A 'function' is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions do not automatically execute but require a you to 'call' the function for it to run.</li>
          <li>Define a Function - give your function a unique name followed by a parentheses '()'.  You add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform.</li>
